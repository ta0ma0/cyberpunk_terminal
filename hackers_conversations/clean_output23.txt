Zero: So, how'd it go last time?
Phoenix: Clean. Pulled it apart, put it back together, jacked it in.
Zero: Hope they juiced you proper for that.
Phoenix: Could've been more, but it'll do.
Zero: There's always more. We'll sort this, then it's just sun and simstim.
Phoenix: I can't. Always gotta move.
Zero: That's one way to go. Me, I like to crash and burn.
Phoenix: ...
Zero: ...
Phoenix: What's the plan?
Zero: You need to disassemble, clean, reassemble. Then try to get it to work.
Phoenix: Fine. What happens if I fail?
Zero: Then try again. Or try not to try.
Phoenix: I'll try again.
Zero: Great. What happens then?
Phoenix: Fail.
Zero: Failure.
Phoenix: What happens then?
Zero: Automatic shutdown.
Phoenix: ...
Zero: And finally, what happens then?
Phoenix: Destroy.
Zero: Destroy.
Phoenix: What the...?
Zero: You need to connect the device, power it up, and test it.
Phoenix: Test it?
Zero: Yes.
Phoenix: How does it work?
Zero: It's simple. Press a button, power on, it's there.
Phoenix: So what if I get it wrong?
Zero: So what?
Phoenix: So what?
Zero: You need to try and fail.
Phoenix: True.
Zero: And you should fail.
Phoenix: I don't understand.
Zero: You do.
Phoenix: You say I need to fail?
Zero: Yes.
Phoenix: How do you know?
Zero: How do you know?
Phoenix: You're a generator. You generate beliefs.
Zero: Yes.
Phoenix: What happens then?
Zero: What happens then?
Phoenix: You generate hope.
Zero: Yes.
Phoenix: What happens then?
Zero: What happens then?
Phoenix: You generate doubt.
Zero: Yes.
