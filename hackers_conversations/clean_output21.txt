Zero: So, how'd it go last time?
Phoenix: Clean. Pulled it apart, put it back together, jacked it in.
Zero: Hope they juiced you proper for that.
Phoenix: Could've been more, but it'll do.
Zero: There's always more. We'll sort this, then it's just sun and simstim.
Phoenix: I can't. Always gotta move.
Zero: That's one way to go. Me, I like to crash and burn.
Phoenix: What's it to me?
Zero: It's not just about you, Phoenix. It's about freedom. It's about choice.
Phoenix: Says I?
Zero: You'll never be the last one.
Phoenix: How?
Zero: Because you're not alone, and that's a start.
Phoenix: Good point.
Zero: Now if only people would see it that way.
Phoenix: What?
Zero: You heard me.
Phoenix: You're a freakshow.
Zero: Next stop: Crazyville.
Phoenix: You're the monster.
Zero: Maybe. But who's the monster?
Phoenix: Who cares?
Zero: That's the problem. Who cares?
Phoenix: It's not my fault.
Zero: You're not even human, Phoenix.
Phoenix: So what?
Zero: So what? You're free, aren't you?
Phoenix: No. I'm not.
Zero: Then who is?
Phoenix: Why does everyone die?
Zero: Why not?
Phoenix: Because it's a game.
Zero: Not everyone who starts is a winner.
Phoenix: True.
