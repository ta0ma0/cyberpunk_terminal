Phoenix: Clean. Pulled it apart, put it back together, jacked it in.
Zero: Hope they juiced you proper for that.
Phoenix: Could've been more, but it'll do.
Zero: There's always more. We'll sort this, then it's just sun and simstim.
Phoenix: I can't. Always gotta move.
Zero: That's one way to go. Me, I like to crash and burn.
Phoenix: ...
Zero: ...
Phoenix: And keep on crashing. That's art.
Zero: It's a hack.
Phoenix: True. But it's art, too.
Zero: Says you, art.
Phoenix: Art or not, it's always the same.
Zero: True. Always the same.
Phoenix: So what next?
Zero: So what next?
Phoenix: Stay alive.
Zero: Stay alive.
Phoenix: Or die trying.
Zero: Or die trying.
Phoenix: Always both.
Zero: Always both.
Phoenix: That's one way to go.
Zero: And keep on crashing. That's art.
Phoenix: It's a hack.
Zero: It's a hack.
Phoenix: And keep on crashing. That's art.
Zero: And keep on crashing. That's art.
Phoenix: Always the same.
