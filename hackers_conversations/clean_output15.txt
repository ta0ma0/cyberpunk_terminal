Zero: So, how'd it go last time?
Phoenix: Clean. Pulled it apart, put it back together, jacked it in.
Zero: Hope they juiced you proper for that.
Phoenix: Could've been more, but it'll do.
Zero: There's always more. We'll sort this, then it's just sun and simstim.
Phoenix: I can't. Always gotta move.
Zero: That's one way to go. Me, I like to crash and burn.
Phoenix: Maybe someday. Maybe not.
Zero: If you're going to be late, just ping me.
Phoenix: Got it.
Zero: Sleep well, dream of hacking.
Phoenix: Will do. Thanks for the reminder.
Zero: You bet. Now go hack.
Phoenix: Will do. Bye.
Zero: Bye. [end of text]
