Zero: So, how'd it go last time?
Phoenix: Clean. Pulled it apart, put it back together, jacked it in.
Zero: Hope they juiced you proper for that.
Phoenix: Could've been more, but it'll do.
Zero: There's always more. We'll sort this, then it's just sun and simstim.
Phoenix: I can't. Always gotta move.
Zero: That's one way to go. Me, I like to crash and burn.
Phoenix: And live.
Zero: And die. That's life.
Phoenix: Right. So, how'd your last conversion go?
Zero: Good, actually. Got a lot of work done.
Phoenix: What's next?
Zero: More work, maybe. Don't think it'll be too hard.
Phoenix: Sounds like it.
Zero: And what about you?
Phoenix: Went okay?
Zero: Yes, yes. No problems.
Phoenix: That's nice.
Zero: And how's your new converter coming along?
Phoenix: Still on the way.
Zero: Well, it's never good when it's not done.
Phoenix: It's not. But I guess I can't wait forever.
Zero: Not even then.
Phoenix: No.
