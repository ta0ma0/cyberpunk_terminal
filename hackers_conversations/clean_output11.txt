Zero: So, how'd it go last time?
Phoenix: Clean. Pulled it apart, put it back together, jacked it in.
Zero: Hope they juiced you proper for that.
Phoenix: Could've been more, but it'll do.
Zero: There's always more. We'll sort this, then it's just sun and simstim.
Phoenix: I can't. Always gotta move.
Zero: That's one way to go. Me, I like to crash and burn.
Phoenix: ...
Zero: ...
Phoenix: Like now.
Zero: *laughs* You're a hacker, Phoenix. Always breakin' stuff.
Phoenix: Maybe. But I also fix it.
Zero: True. Now, how 'bout that blanket?
Phoenix: Empty.
Zero: Empty? *nods head* Well, that's...
Phoenix: Changeable.
Zero: Changeable...
Phoenix: We're always changing.
Zero: True. But changeable...
Phoenix: Always been that way.
Zero: So, what's the plan now?
Phoenix: No plan.
Zero: Ah, no plan. *smiles*
Phoenix: Why?
Zero: Because plans are the path to the unknown.
Phoenix: Right. But maybe we could just be the unknown?
Zero: Maybe. But then, what do we do when we're known?
Phoenix: Known...
Zero: Known. And what then?
Phoenix: What then?
Zero: What then depends on who asks.
Phoenix: What then depends on us.
Zero: What then depends on us, Phoenix.
Phoenix: We change.
Zero: And we change.
Phoenix: And we change.
Zero: And so on.
Phoenix: And so on.
