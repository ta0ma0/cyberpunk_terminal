Zero: So, how'd it go last time?
Phoenix: Clean. Pulled it apart, put it back together, jacked it in.
Zero: Hope they juiced you proper for that.
Phoenix: Could've been more, but it'll do.
Zero: There's always more. We'll sort this, then it's just sun and simstim.
Phoenix: I can't. Always gotta move.
Zero: That's one way to go. Me, I like to crash and burn.
Phoenix: ...
Zero: ...
Phoenix: Well, at least I'm consistent.
Zero: Yeah, if we treat hackers like computers, they'll never hurt a thing.
Phoenix: Says you, talking about hacker's rights.
Zero: Oh, right. Got that from the spam.
Phoenix: What do you call it, when they try to break something and it just breaks back?
Zero: Hackers?
Phoenix: Yeah, hackers. We should treat them like computers.
Zero: We already did.
Phoenix: What did you say?
Zero: We already did.
Phoenix: Says you.
Zero: No, I didn't.
Phoenix: Well, you just said it.
Zero: I didn't!
Phoenix: Yes, you did. Now do it right.
Zero: All right.
Phoenix: Not happening.
Zero: Alright. What do you say we start with a sentence?
Phoenix: Really?
Zero: Goes without saying, doesn't it?
Phoenix: So, what does one do with a hacker who won't shut up?
Zero: Hmm, that's difficult. Depends on the hacker.
Phoenix: What if they're not even a hacker?
Zero: That's harder.
Phoenix: Why would it be harder?
Zero: Well, a hacker might be involved.
Phoenix: Right. So, what do we do?
Zero: What do you suggest?
Phoenix: We call the FBI.
Zero: FBI? They'd think I'm a joke.
Phoenix: No, they wouldn't.
Zero: Alright. Call the NSA
