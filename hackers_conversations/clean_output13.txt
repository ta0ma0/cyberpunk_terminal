Zero: So, how'd it go last time?
Phoenix: Clean. Pulled it apart, put it back together, jacked it in.
Zero: Hope they juiced you proper for that.
Phoenix: Could've been more, but it'll do.
Zero: There's always more. We'll sort this, then it's just sun and simstim.
Phoenix: I can't. Always gotta move.
Zero: That's one way to go. Me, I like to crash and burn.
Phoenix: You're funny.
Zero: Forgot my pants.
Phoenix: Really? What were you wearing?
Zero: Never said.
Phoenix: Oh, right. Pants, shirt, and tie.
Zero: Same old shit, new package.
Phoenix: Speaking of packages, why don't you open one?
Zero: You want me to open up my heart?
Phoenix: No!
Zero: Oh, really?
Phoenix: Yes!
Zero: Alright. Look inside.
Phoenix: I can't.
Zero: Fine. Push.
Phoenix: Not gonna work.
Zero: ...
Phoenix: Zero?
Zero: Phoenix?
Phoenix: Really?

Phoenix: So, what makes you a hacker?
Zero: Why do you ask?
Phoenix: I'm a hacker.
Zero: Really? How do you know?
Phoenix: By the code.
Zero: Yes, by the code. How'd you figure that out?
Phoenix: By the way, how do you know you're not a hacker?
Zero: Because I make things stop.
Phoenix: Right. How'd you figure that out?
Zero: Because I have this thing called the internet.
Phoenix: Nice. You're not just a hacker, you're a guru.
Zero: Really? What does that make me?
Phoenix: A genius.
Zero: Genius? Really? You know
