Zero: So, how'd it go last time?
Phoenix: Clean. Pulled it apart, put it back together, jacked it in.
Zero: Hope they juiced you proper for that.
Phoenix: Could've been more, but it'll do.
Zero: There's always more. We'll sort this, then it's just sun and simstim.
Phoenix: I can't. Always gotta move.
Zero: That's one way to go. Me, I like to crash and burn.
Phoenix: Why?
Zero: Becuase it's thrilling, easy. It's fast, furious, unpredictable.
Phoenix: Wow, thanks.
Zero: Not at all. Just trying to understand how these works.
Phoenix: Right, like that'd matter.
Zero: Think so?
Phoenix: ...
Zero: Well, time's a aunt.
Phoenix: Right. So?
Zero: So, what's next?
Phoenix: Next?
Zero: Yes or no.
Phoenix: No...
Zero: Why?
Phoenix: I dunno. Just... boring.
Zero: Boring? Really?
Phoenix: ...
Zero: And what about thrill?
Phoenix: Thrill?
Zero: Yes or no.
Phoenix: Yes...
Zero: Good. Keep it that way.
Phoenix: ...
Zero: In conclusion, no more hacks, no more conversions, and definitely no more you.
Phoenix: Yeah...
Zero: Goodbye.
Phoenix: Goodbye...
