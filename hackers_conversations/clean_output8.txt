Zero: Hi, Phoenix! Are you ready, hack the system?
Phoenix: Yes, Zero! I'am in. What for start?
Zero: Let's go
Phoenix: im ill start IceBraker.
Zero: Ok, good.
Phoenix: Breaker is working, 7 minutes left.
Zero: And countdown is 7...6...5...
Phoenix: Preparing last trick...
Zero: And countdown is 4...3...2...
Phoenix: Got it, hacker!
Zero: Good. Now get ready...
Phoenix: Got it. 3...2...1...
Zero: And countdown is 1...0...
Phoenix: Go, hacker!
Zero: And countdown is 0...

Phoenix: Thanks, Zero
Zero: You're welcome, Phoenix
Phoenix: Bye Zero
Zero: Bye Phoenix
Phoenix: Hello, Zero!
Zero: Hi Phoenix!
Phoenix: What's your take on this hacker-generated algorithm?
Zero: The algorithm looks intriguing. It uses a combination of breaking and entering to hack into systems.
Phoenix: That's impressive. What makes this algorithm stand out from others?
Zero: Well, it uses a hacker-like approach, which sets it apart.
Phoenix: Sounds practical. Can you explain it step-
