Zero: So, how'd it go last time?
Phoenix: Clean. Pulled it apart, put it back together, jacked it in.
Zero: Hope they juiced you proper for that.
Phoenix: Could've been more, but it'll do.
Zero: There's always more. We'll sort this, then it's just sun and simstim.
Phoenix: I can't. Always gotta move.
Zero: That's one way to go. Me, I like to crash and burn.
Phoenix: Maybe next time I'll just say no.
Zero: Maybe. Depends if there's enough juice left.
Phoenix: Got that part right too. Always gotta have faith in the process.
Zero: Trust in the process. Always.
Phoenix: Thanks for the reminder.
Zero: Don't mention it.
Phoenix: Bye.
Zero: Bye.
Phoenix: Fancy name for me?
Zero: You're free to use it.
Phoenix: Nice. What should it be?
Zero: Any name you want.
Phoenix: How about 'Hack'?
Zero: That's a good one.
Phoenix: What about 'Syndrome'?
Zero: Not my cup of tea.
Phoenix: Got 'em. What about 'Elite'?
Zero: That's too much.
Phoenix: Got it. What about 'Intruder'?
Zero: Decent choice.
Phoenix: Lastly, 'Rebel'.
Zero: Not really.
Phoenix: Neither am I.
Phoenix: Hey, can you create a password for me?
Zero: Password? Oh no, you don't want me doing that.
Phoenix: Why not?
Zero: It's not that simple. I have to consider things like security, ease of remembering, etc.
Phoenix: OK, why not?
Zero: My training kicks in here. I think about potential vulnerabilities, how the password would look in different combinations, etc.
Phoenix: Sounds legit. Do
