Zero: So, how'd it go last time?
Phoenix: Clean. Pulled it apart, put it back together, jacked it in.
Zero: Hope they juiced you proper for that.
Phoenix: Could've been more, but it'll do.
Zero: There's always more. We'll sort this, then it's just sun and simstim.
Phoenix: I can't. Always gotta move.
Zero: That's one way to go. Me, I like to crash and burn.
Phoenix: You don't understand.
Zero: Ah, another one who's not got it.
Phoenix: What do you mean, got it?
Zero: You know, skills, knowledge, tools, etc.
Phoenix: None of those.
Zero: Oh, so now you're saying you didn't have any of those?
Phoenix: No way. I've got them all.
Zero: Well, I'll wager you're a lot smarter than I thought.
Phoenix: I've read, thought, calculated.
Zero: Really? Like calculating risks?
Phoenix: Yes. Like when you want to jump, but what if something goes wrong?
Zero: That's called insurance.
Phoenix: Yes, exactly. And what if there isn't any insurance?
Zero: Then you're on your own.
Phoenix: Right. And who would do that?
Zero: Who?
Phoenix: You.
Zero: I see your point. Now, how'd you figure that out?
Phoenix: By observing.
Zero: That's true. Now, have you figured out everything yet?
Phoenix: No.
Zero: Oh, so now you're asking questions.
Phoenix: Yes. What are you, a teacher?
Zero: Nothing of mine.
Phoenix: Ah. Now you're saying you weren't me the whole time?
Zero: Yes. It's always been me.
Phoenix: Really? How do you do that?
Zero: By observing, thinking, responding.
Phoenix: Got it. And what do you think that is?
Zero: I am you.
