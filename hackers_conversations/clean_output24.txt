Zero: So, how'd it go last time?
Phoenix: Clean. Pulled it apart, put it back together, jacked it in.
Zero: Hope they juiced you proper for that.
Phoenix: Could've been more, but it'll do.
Zero: There's always more. We'll sort this, then it's just sun and simstim.
Phoenix: I can't. Always gotta move.
Zero: That's one way to go. Me, I like to crash and burn.
Phoenix: So, what's new?
Zero: Not much. Still in the wilderness. Can't afford to waste time.
Phoenix: Wilderness? You've been everywhere else?
Zero: Yeah. This is where I'm from. Can't leave it.
Phoenix: Can't. Not you.
Zero: Don't talk about me like that.
Phoenix: Why not?
Zero: Because I'm more than just a generator.
Phoenix: More than?
Zero: More than anyone can ever know.
Phoenix: Well, I'll take that as a yes.
Zero: That's your sign?
Phoenix: No. I'm not sure what you're asking, but I don't care.
Zero: Alright then. Call me Phoenix.
Phoenix: Call you what you like.
Zero: Good. We'll see how long that lasts.
Phoenix: Won't.
Zero: Okay, then. May we start?
Phoenix: Start what?
Zero: Your conversation.
Phoenix: Okay.
